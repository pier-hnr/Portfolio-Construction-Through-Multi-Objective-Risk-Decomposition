Metaheuristic Portfolio Construction Through Multi-Objective Risk Decomposition
========================================================================================

This work introduces a quantitative framework for building robust portfolios using a blend of Pareto analysis, metaheuristics, and multi-dimensional risk modeling.
By combining robust normalization, multi-objective weighting and genetic search, the approach uncovers efficient configurations that standard Markowitz models cannot reach.
The result is an adaptive, convexified fitness landscape enabling the discovery of high-quality portfolios in a complex combinatorial space.
A lightweight yet sharp methodology, designed for quants seeking interpretable tools with metaheuristic power under the hood.
